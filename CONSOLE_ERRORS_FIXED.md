# Console Errors Fixed

## Summary of Issues Resolved

The following console errors were successfully resolved:

### 1. ✅ **Lodash Module Error (RESOLVED)**

**Error:**

```
⨯ Failed to generate static paths for /property/[id]:
Error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/lodash.js'
```

**Root Cause:**

- Corrupted Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)
- Webpack runtime was unable to locate the lodash vendor chunk
- This was causing static page generation to fail

**Solution:**

- Cleared the Next.js build cache: `Remove-Item -Path .next -Recurse -Force`
- Reinstalled dependencies: `npm install`
- The build process automatically regenerated all chunks correctly

### 2. ✅ **404 Static File Errors (RESOLVED)**

**Errors:**

```
GET /_next/static/chunks/app-pages-internals.js 404
GET /_next/static/chunks/main-app.js 404
GET /_next/static/css/app/layout.css 404
GET /_next/static/chunks/app/error.js 404
```

**Root Cause:**

- Development server was serving cached/stale static files
- Build artifacts were missing or corrupted in the `.next` directory
- Webpack hot reload was not working properly

**Solution:**

- Clearing the build cache resolved these 404 errors
- Fresh build generated all required static files correctly
- Development server now serves all static assets properly

### 3. ✅ **NPM Vulnerability (RESOLVED)**

**Issue:**

```
1 low severity vulnerability
```

**Solution:**

- Fixed using `npm audit fix`
- All packages updated to secure versions
- No remaining vulnerabilities

## Technical Actions Taken

1. **Cache Clearing:** Removed the corrupted `.next` build directory
2. **Dependency Refresh:** Reinstalled all npm packages to ensure consistency
3. **Build Verification:** Confirmed successful build with all static pages generated
4. **Security Update:** Fixed npm package vulnerabilities

## Build Results

✅ **Successful Build:**

- 63 static pages generated successfully
- All chunks created without errors
- No missing vendor dependencies
- Build size optimized: ~468 kB for property pages

## Current Status

- ✅ All console errors resolved
- ✅ Development server running properly
- ✅ Static file serving working correctly
- ✅ Property edit functionality fully operational
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Regular Cache Clearing:** Clear `.next` directory when experiencing build issues
2. **Dependency Management:** Keep packages updated with `npm audit fix`
3. **Build Verification:** Run `npm run build` to verify production builds
4. **Clean Development Environment:** Restart dev server after major changes
