# Middleware API Fix - JSON Parsing Issue Resolution

## Problem

API routes were returning HTML (DOCTYPE) instead of JSON, causing "Unexpected token '<'" errors in the frontend. This was happening because the middleware was interfering with API routes and redirecting them.

## Root Cause

The middleware was not properly excluding non-admin API routes, causing them to be intercepted and redirected instead of returning JSON responses.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Middleware API Route Exclusion (`middleware.ts`)

**Added comprehensive API route bypass:**

```typescript
// Skip middleware for static files and Next.js internal routes
if (
  pathname.startsWith("/_next") ||
  pathname.includes(".") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/favicon") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/api/auth/") ||
  pathname.startsWith("/static/") ||
  // Skip middleware for all non-admin API routes
  (pathname.startsWith("/api/") && !pathname.startsWith("/api/admin/"))
) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### 2. Added API Endpoints to Public Paths

Added these API routes to the public paths array:

- `/api/cities` and `/api/cities/*`
- `/api/seed-cities`
- `/api/update-city-counts`
- `/api/travel-picks` and `/api/travel-picks/*`
- `/api/properties` and `/api/properties/*`

### 3. Fixed Travel Picks API

**Before:** Making internal fetch call that could cause issues
**After:** Direct database query in the public endpoint

### 4. Simplified Frontend Error Handling

Removed complex error handling that was added for debugging and reverted to simple, clean error messages.

## Result

- ✅ Cities API now returns proper JSON responses
- ✅ Travel Picks API works correctly
- ✅ No more "Unexpected token '<'" errors
- ✅ All public API routes bypass middleware correctly
- ✅ Admin routes remain protected

## Testing

1. Visit homepage - cities and travel picks should load
2. Check browser console - no JSON parsing errors
3. Verify `/api/cities` returns JSON (not HTML)
4. Confirm admin routes still require authentication

## Files Modified

1. `my-app/middleware.ts` - Enhanced API route exclusion
2. `my-app/app/api/travel-picks/route.ts` - Fixed to use direct DB queries
3. `my-app/app/api/cities/route.ts` - Simplified to original version
4. `my-app/components/layout/popular-cities.tsx` - Removed debug logging
5. `my-app/components/layout/travel-picks.tsx` - Added better error handling
6. Frontend components - Reverted to clean error handling

The fix ensures that public API routes work correctly while maintaining admin route security.
