# Booking Flow Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch (CRITICAL)**

**Problem**: The booking form was sending `checkInDate`/`checkOutDate` but the database schema expected `dateFrom`/`dateTo`.

**Files Fixed**:

- `app/booking/page.tsx` - Updated booking data structure
- `services/booking-service.ts` - Fixed field names in queries and calculations
- `app/api/bookings/route.ts` - Updated field validation
- `models/Booking.ts` - Enhanced schema with proper field definitions
- `app/booking/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated booking details display

**Changes Made**:

```javascript
// Before (WRONG)
const bookingData = {
  checkInDate: checkIn?.toISOString(),
  checkOutDate: checkOut?.toISOString(),
  // ...
};

// After (CORRECT)
const bookingData = {
  dateFrom: checkIn?.toISOString(),
  dateTo: checkOut?.toISOString(),
  // ...
};
```

### 2. **Incomplete Database Schema**

**Problem**: The Booking model was missing essential fields that the frontend was sending.

**Fixed in `models/Booking.ts`**:

- Added `guests` field (required)
- Added `totalPrice` field
- Added `pricePerNight` field
- Added `propertyName` field
- Added `contactDetails` object with name, email, phone
- Added `specialRequests` field
- Made `dateFrom` and `dateTo` required fields

### 3. **Poor Error Handling**

**Problem**: When booking creation failed, the form would create mock booking IDs instead of showing proper error messages.

**Fixed in `app/booking/page.tsx`**:

- Removed mock booking ID fallback
- Added proper error throwing and handling
- Improved user feedback with toast notifications
- Better navigation using `router.push()` instead of `window.location.replace()`

### 4. **API Validation Issues**

**Problem**: The API was validating for wrong field names.

**Fixed in `app/api/bookings/route.ts`**:

```javascript
// Before
const requiredFields = ["propertyId", "checkInDate", "checkOutDate", "guests"];

// After
const requiredFields = ["propertyId", "dateFrom", "dateTo", "guests"];
```

### 5. **Service Layer Inconsistencies**

**Problem**: BookingService methods were using inconsistent field names.

**Fixed in `services/booking-service.ts`**:

- Updated sorting to use `dateFrom` instead of `checkInDate`
- Fixed availability checking to use correct field names
- Updated price calculation function

## Testing

A test script has been created (`test-booking-flow.js`) to verify the booking flow works correctly.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to a property page** and try to book it

3. **Fill out the booking form** with valid details

4. **Submit the form** - it should now:

   - Create a real booking in the database (not a mock ID)
   - Redirect to the booking details page (`/booking/[id]`)
   - Display the booking information correctly

5. **Check the console logs** for debugging information

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Booking form submits successfully
2. ✅ Real booking is created in database
3. ✅ User is redirected to booking details page
4. ✅ Booking details display correctly
5. ✅ No more redirects to homepage
6. ✅ Proper error messages if something fails

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Ensure users are properly authenticated before booking
2. **Property Validation**: Verify the property exists and is available
3. **Payment Integration**: The booking flow creates confirmed bookings - integrate with payment processing
4. **Email Notifications**: Consider sending booking confirmation emails
5. **Availability Checking**: Ensure proper date overlap checking for property availability

## Files Modified

- ✅ `app/booking/page.tsx`
- ✅ `services/booking-service.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/bookings/route.ts`
- ✅ `models/Booking.ts`
- ✅ `app/booking/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `test-booking-flow.js` (new)

## Backward Compatibility

The booking details page (`app/booking/[id]/page.tsx`) and checkout page (`app/checkout/page.tsx`) have been updated to handle both old and new field names with fallbacks:

```javascript
// Handles both old and new field names
const checkIn = new Date(booking.dateFrom || booking.checkInDate);
const checkOut = new Date(booking.dateTo || booking.checkOutDate);
```

This ensures existing bookings (if any) continue to work while new bookings use the correct field names.
