# PMS Cleanup - Issues Resolved

**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## Issues Encountered After PMS Cleanup

After removing 498 PMS files from the main website, two console errors were discovered during runtime.

---

## Issue 1: Module Not Found Error

### Error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/models/reportTypes'
```

### Root Cause:
The `reportTypes` model was deleted during PMS cleanup because it was assumed to be PMS-only (business analytics reports). However, the main website has a **customer report system** where users can report issues with properties, bookings, reviews, or other users for moderation purposes.

### Impact:
- 8 files unable to compile
- Report functionality broken
- Dev server failing to start

### Files Affected:
1. `components/forms/report-form.tsx`
2. `hooks/use-report.tsx`
3. `components/ui/report-button.tsx`
4. `app/admin/reports/page.tsx`
5. `app/booking/[id]/page.tsx`
6. `app/user/[id]/page.tsx`
7. `app/user/reports/page.tsx`
8. `app/property/[id]/page.tsx`

### Solution:
Created a new **customer-facing Report model** separate from PMS reporting:

#### Created Files:
1. **`models/Report.ts`** - Mongoose model for customer reports
   - Schema for storing user-reported issues
   - Indexes for efficient queries
   - Server-side only

2. **`types/report.ts`** - Type definitions (client-safe)
   - `ReportType` enum (13 types)
   - `ReportTargetType` enum (4 types)
   - `ReportStatus` enum (5 statuses)
   - `CustomerReport` interface

#### Report Types:
```typescript
enum ReportType {
  INAPPROPRIATE_CONTENT
  MISLEADING_INFORMATION
  SCAM_OR_FRAUD
  SAFETY_CONCERN
  DISCRIMINATION
  SPAM
  HARASSMENT
  FAKE_LISTING
  PRICING_ISSUE
  QUALITY_ISSUE
  CANCELLATION_ISSUE
  PAYMENT_ISSUE
  OTHER
}
```

#### Updated Imports:
Changed from:
```typescript
import { ReportType, ReportTargetType } from '@/models/reportTypes';
```

To:
```typescript
import { ReportType, ReportTargetType } from '@/models/Report';
```

### Result:
✅ Module found
✅ All 8 files compiling successfully
✅ Customer report functionality restored

---

## Issue 2: Runtime TypeError

### Error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Report')
at mongoose.models.Report
```

### Root Cause:
The Report model was being imported in **client-side components**, but Mongoose models can only be instantiated on the server side. When the client tries to access `mongoose.models.Report`, `mongoose.models` is undefined in the browser environment.

### Impact:
- App crashing on page load
- ErrorBoundary catching errors
- Client components failing to render

### Files Affected:
- Any client component importing from `@/models/Report`
- Specifically: `components/forms/report-form.tsx`, `hooks/use-report.tsx`

### Solution:
**Separated enums from Mongoose model:**

#### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
// models/Report.ts
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

export enum ReportType { ... } // ❌ Can't use in client
export enum ReportTargetType { ... } // ❌ Can't use in client

const Report = mongoose.models.Report || mongoose.model(...);
export default Report; // ❌ Causes error in client
```

#### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// types/report.ts (Client-safe)
export enum ReportType { ... } // ✅ Safe for client
export enum ReportTargetType { ... } // ✅ Safe for client
export enum ReportStatus { ... } // ✅ Safe for client

// models/Report.ts (Server-only)
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import { ReportType, ReportTargetType, ReportStatus } from '@/types/report';

// Re-export for backward compatibility
export { ReportType, ReportTargetType, ReportStatus };

const Report = mongoose.models.Report || mongoose.model(...);
export default Report; // ✅ Only used on server
```

#### Import Strategy:
- **Client components**: Import from `@/types/report`
- **Server components/API routes**: Import from `@/models/Report`
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Result:
✅ No more runtime errors
✅ Client components work correctly
✅ Server-side model works correctly
✅ Type safety maintained

## Distinction: Customer Reports vs PMS Reports

### Customer Reports (Main Website) ✅ Kept
**Purpose**: User moderation and safety
- Users report problematic content/behavior
- Types: Scams, harassment, fake listings, safety issues
- Handled by admin team
- Part of customer-facing platform

**Files**:
- `models/Report.ts`
- `types/report.ts`
- `components/forms/report-form.tsx`
- `app/admin/reports/` - Admin moderation panel

### PMS Reports (Removed) ✅ Moved to PMS
**Purpose**: Business intelligence and analytics
- Occupancy reports
- Revenue reports
- Staff performance reports
- Financial reports
- Operational analytics

**Files**: All moved to `baithaka-ghar-pms` repository

## Commits

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Client vs Server Code Separation
- **Never import Mongoose models in client components**
- Separate types/enums into client-safe files
- Use conditional imports where needed

### 2. Distinguish Feature Context
- Same feature name != same feature
- "Reports" in customer context ≠ "Reports" in PMS context
- Analyze usage before deletion

### 3. Runtime Testing Important
- Build success ≠ Runtime success
- Test in browser after major changes
- Check both SSR and CSR

### 4. Type System Structure
```
types/           ← Client-safe types, enums, interfaces
models/          ← Server-only Mongoose models
lib/             ← Shared utilities (check client safety)
```

## Conclusion

Both issues stemming from the PMS cleanup have been successfully resolved. The main website now:
- Has a properly structured customer report system
- Maintains clear separation between client and server code
- Works without any console errors
- Preserves all customer-facing functionality

The PMS separation project remains **100% complete** with these post-cleanup fixes applied.

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
