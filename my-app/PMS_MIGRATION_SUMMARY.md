## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Read `PMS_SEPARATION_DOCUMENTATION.md` (this folder)
   - Read `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` (PMS project folder)
   - Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (PMS project folder)

2. **Start Models Migration**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\baithaka-ghar-pms"
   mkdir -p src/models/core src/models/operations src/models/financial src/models/fb src/models/events
   ```

3. **Copy First Models**
   Start with core authentication models from this project:
   - `models/PropertyLogin.ts`
   - `models/PropertyPermission.ts`
   - `models/UserRole.ts`
   - `models/UserSession.ts`

4. **Update Imports**
   For each copied model, update import paths to use `@/` alias

5. **Test Build**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\baithaka-ghar-pms"
   npm run build
   ```

### Migration Phases

Follow the 10-phase plan in `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`:

1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Pre-Migration Setup (COMPLETE)
2. 🔄 **Phase 2**: Models Migration (NEXT - 1-2 days)
3. ⏳ **Phase 3**: Authentication System (2 days)
4. ⏳ **Phase 4**: API Routes (3-4 days)
5. ⏳ **Phase 5**: Hooks (1 day)
6. ⏳ **Phase 6**: Components (3-4 days)
7. ⏳ **Phase 7**: Pages (2-3 days)
8. ⏳ **Phase 8**: Layout & Navigation (1 day)
9. ⏳ **Phase 9**: Environment Config (1 day)
10. ⏳ **Phase 10**: Testing (3-4 days)

**After Migration**: Cleanup this project (Phase 11)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Terminology Clarification

**What was called "OS"** is actually **PMS (Property Management System)**:
- Manages individual hotel operations
- Staff management, bookings, F&B, events
- The system being migrated

**Actual OS (Owner System)** is a **future** system:
- Owner's perspective of the entire platform
- Multi-property portfolio management
- Not yet built

### Three Separate Systems

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Main Website          │ ← Guest booking, property listings
│   (Keep this clean)     │
└─────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   PMS (This Migration)  │ ← Hotel operations, staff, F&B
│   (New separate app)    │
└─────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Future OS             │ ← Owner portfolio, multi-property
│   (Not yet built)       │
└─────────────────────────┘
```
