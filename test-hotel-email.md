- âœ… Updated interface and schema in `my-app/models/Property.ts`

### 2. Property Listing Form Updates

- âœ… Added hotel email field to listing form in `my-app/app/list-property/page.tsx`
- âœ… Added validation for hotel email format (optional but valid when provided)
- âœ… Updated form data interface and validation summary

### 3. Admin Edit Property Updates

- âœ… Added hotel email field to admin edit modal in `my-app/components/admin/property/PropertyEditModal.tsx`
- âœ… Added field to Contact Information section
- âœ… Updated form data handling and submission

### 4. API Updates

### 5. Booking Email Service Enhancement

- âœ… **MAJOR UPGRADE**: Enhanced booking confirmation emails in `my-app/services/booking-service.ts`
- âœ… Now sends emails to **3 recipients simultaneously**:
  1. **Guest** (user who made the booking)
  2. **Property Owner** (using existing email field)
  3. **Hotel Staff** (using new hotelEmail field, if provided and different)
- âœ… Added intelligent recipient logic with detailed logging
- âœ… Handles missing hotel email gracefully (falls back to current behavior)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Add Hotel Email to New Property

1. Go to `/list-property`
2. Fill out property details
3. In basic info section, you should see "Hotel Email (Optional)" field
4. Add a hotel email (e.g., `hotel@test.com`)
5. Complete property listing
6. Verify property is saved with hotel email

### Test 2: Edit Existing Property (Admin)

1. Login as admin
2. Go to `/admin/properties`
3. Click "Edit Property" on any property
4. In the "Contact Information" section, you should see "Hotel Email" field
5. Add or update hotel email
6. Save changes
7. Verify update was successful

### Test 3: Booking Email Test

1. Create a property with hotel email different from owner email
2. Make a booking on that property
3. Check server logs - you should see:
   ```
   [BookingService] Sending emails to 3 recipients:
   guest: user@email.com, owner: owner@email.com, hotel: hotel@email.com
   ```
4. Verify all three recipients receive booking confirmation emails

### Test 4: Edge Cases

- Test with empty hotel email (should work normally)
- Test with hotel email same as owner email (should only send 2 emails)
- Test with invalid hotel email format (should show validation error)

## ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing properties work unchanged
2. **Graceful Fallback**: If no hotel email, uses current behavior
